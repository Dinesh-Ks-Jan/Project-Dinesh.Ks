Hi Team,

I worked all this queries in online compiler so i wasnt able to create database. So i have just added the database creation and use syntax for which ever project it was asked. Just wanted to let you guys know.

Library Management System (using SQL) - worked in MySQL
Employee Payroll Management System (PostgreSQL) - worked in PostgreSQL
Online Store Order Management System (PostgreSQL) - worked in PostgreSQL
Movie Rental Analysis System (using Redshift or PostgreSQL) - worked in PostgreSQL

All the 4 projects are attached in .sql file format and output screenshots taken from online compiler also included here.

Thanks.
